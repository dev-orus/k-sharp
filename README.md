<h1 align="center">Wisp</h1>

<h3 align="center">Wisp is a programing language that has similar syntax to C and transpiles to Python</h3>

## We are re writing
We are re writing this project due to major bugs. both in the transpiler and lsp communicator with jedi. We need some help to make the lsp communication better and less buggy.

## Install

- Make sure you have python3.12 or newer
- `git clone https://github.com/dev-orus/wisp.git`
- `cd wisp`
- `python3 install.py`

## Using it

- Initialize a Project: `wisp init`
- Install pip requirements in the ksconfig file and env: `wisp install`
- Build project (Transpile to Python): `wisp build`
- Build project and run it: `wisp run`

## OOP

This programing lanaguage isn't meant to be too much Object Oriented like Java or Python. it's more like c/c++ ish where you focus on variables, structs, and functions, classes are last
